In this project, we prepare 3 presentations on the topic “Climate Research and AI” mainly based on a paper :  
“2019, Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05433.pdf  
And organisation site: https://www.climatechange.ai/


**For the first presentation,** we gave a brief introduction to machine learning, by explaining the terminology which will be used on the project. What is Artificial intelligence, what is machine learning, what are subtypes, what are relationship between them etc. Also, we talked about some history then in to some refresher for climate change and its consequences. After the introduction phase, we gave headlines of our topics by leaving the details for next iterations.

**For the second presentation,** we dived in to more details and gave some commercial and non-profit examples of use-cases of AI in the climate research. The selected topics are **Electricity Systems, Precision Agriculture, Climate Prediction and Individiaul/Collective Aspects.**

**And for the final iteration,** we gave overall and final thoughts on the project by merging all of the previous iterations. Also we continued to selected research topics above along with **Industry, CO2 Removal** and some use-case examples such as **Smart cities and Predicting Emission Factors.**
